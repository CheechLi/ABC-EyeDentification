Ocular diseases — a broad term for conditions that affect parts of the eye like the cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve — affect roughly **2.2 billion people** around the world. Furthermore, almost **two-thirds of adults** report experiencing vision issues, yet only **one in eight** report seeking care.

This has caused conditions like **glaucoma**, **cataracts**, and **diabetic retinopathy** to often go unnoticed until they’ve already caused **permanent vision loss**.
