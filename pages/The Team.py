We are a student team from the **MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) Medlytics program**.  
Our project focuses on using AI for early detection of ocular diseases using retinal images.

### Our Goal
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 
2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from vision impairment, yet many do not have access to regular eye care.
At least a billion of these cases could have been prevented or treated with early detection and intervention.  
We aim to bridge this gap by developing a smart classifier that can help detect common ocular diseases early
and provide a platform for students and researchers to explore medical AI hands-on.
We invite volunteers to upload ocular images to help us diversify our dataset and improve model performance.
