We are a student team from the **MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) Medlytics program**.  
Our project focuses on using AI for early detection of eye diseases using retinal images.

### Our Goal
Our goal? Build a smart, accessible, and slightly nerdy tool that helps people learn about eye diseases—and maybe even spot them—just from fundus images (aka fancy eyeball pics). We want to raise awareness about how common and sneaky ocular conditions can be, and create a model that’s not here to replace your ophthalmologist, but to give them a helpful nudge. As we gather more data (thanks to generous volunteers and curious students), we’ll keep training and improving our model until it’s sharp enough to catch even the tiniest red flags—because healthy eyes deserve 20/20 tech.
